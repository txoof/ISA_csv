# ISA_csv
Convert csv file exported from PowerSchool to format ready for ISA upload.

Be warned. There is hardly any error checking and pretty much everything is hard-coded

## Getting started:
1. Prepare a CSV in powerschool and download to computer
2. Download the .py file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txoof/ISA_csv/main/ISA_csv.py)
3. Open a terminal window and run: `python3 ./ISA_csv.py <powerschool_csv_export.csv>`
4. A new file will be created in the same location as the original with a similar name that includes the date and time.
